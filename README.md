# BIO539_Final

Description of assignment:

"This project is meant for you to apply the skills you learned in class to your research.

Submit the following:

1. Exploratory analysis of research data (submitted as an Rmarkdown or Jupyter notebook and including explanations). As with assignment 1, this should look like a lab notebook, full of your thought process, graphical, and statistical output.


2. A ~2000 word paper on your research including relevant and significant results from the analysis. The Methods and Results sections should be complete. The Introduction and Discussion sections may be brief.

3. A Github repository, fully commented, with a Readme so that I can replicate the analysis in full."
