# BIO539_Final

This repository contains:

1) An RMarkdown file which acted as my analytic "lab notebook". It contains notes on the reasoning/importance of the project, filtering the data, which factors to include in models, and certain plots which were left out from the final analysis and discussion. 

2) An R file that contains all the code need to replicate my results. My results are based on analysis of model fitting, model selection, and visual inspection of generated graphics.

3) The dataset used in the analysis.

4) A final PDF write-up featuring an intorduction, methods, results, discussion, references, tables, and figures.
